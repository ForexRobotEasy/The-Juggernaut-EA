# The Juggernaut EA

The Juggernaut EA is a forex trading Expert Advisor (EA) developed by the Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to trade the AUDUSD currency pair on the H4 chart using a combination of 50 synergistic strategies. The EA adapts to market conditions based on a volatility threshold and executes the most suitable strategy for the current market situation.

## Input Parameters

The Juggernaut EA has two input parameters:

1. StrategyCount: This parameter determines the number of synergistic strategies used by the EA. The default value is set to 50, but it can be adjusted based on the user's preference and trading strategy.

2. VolatilityThreshold: This parameter sets the volatility threshold for market adaptation. If the calculated volatility of the AUDUSD H4 chart exceeds this threshold, the EA will adapt its strategy accordingly. The default value is set to 20, but it can be modified to suit different market conditions.

## Global Variables

The Juggernaut EA utilizes a global variable called 'currentStrategy' to keep track of the current active strategy.

## Expert Initialization Function

The 'OnInit' function is the expert initialization function. It is called once when the EA is first attached to a chart. In this function, the Juggernaut EA is initialized and any necessary setup or initialization tasks are performed. This function returns INIT_SUCCEEDED to indicate successful initialization.

## Expert Deinitialization Function

The 'OnDeinit' function is the expert deinitialization function. It is called when the EA is removed from the chart or when the terminal is shut down. In this function, the Juggernaut EA is deinitialized, and any necessary cleanup tasks are performed. The function also prints a message to indicate that the EA has been deinitialized.

## Expert Tick Function

The 'OnTick' function is the expert tick function. It is called on every tick of the chart. In this function, the Juggernaut EA analyzes the AUDUSD H4 chart, determines market conditions, adapts to market movements based on volatility, and executes the trading strategy.

## Calculate Volatility Function

The 'CalculateVolatility' function calculates the volatility of the AUDUSD H4 chart. The code to calculate volatility is not provided in this sample code and should be implemented separately. The function returns the calculated volatility value.

## Check Trend Function

## Adapt Strategy Function
